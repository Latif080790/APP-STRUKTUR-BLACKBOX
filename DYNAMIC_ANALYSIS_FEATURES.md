## Overview

This document describes the dynamic analysis capabilities that have been implemented in the Structural Analysis System, including modal analysis and response spectrum analysis.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Modal Analysis

Modal analysis is a technique used to determine the natural frequencies and mode shapes of a structure. These properties are fundamental in understanding how a structure will respond to dynamic loads such as earthquakes or wind.

#### Capabilities:
- **Natural Frequency Calculation**: Determines the frequencies at which a structure naturally vibrates
- **Mode Shape Visualization**: Shows the relative displacement pattern of the structure at each natural frequency
- **Period Calculation**: Computes the time period for each mode of vibration
- **Multi-Mode Analysis**: Extracts multiple modes of vibration for comprehensive analysis

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Mass Matrix Calculation**: Computes the lumped mass matrix for the structure
- **Eigenvalue Problem**: Solves the generalized eigenvalue problem [K]{φ} = ω²[M]{φ}
- **Mode Shape Normalization**: Normalizes mode shapes for consistent representation

### 2. Response Spectrum Analysis

Response spectrum analysis is a linear elastic method used to estimate the maximum response of a structure to seismic excitation.

#### Capabilities:
- **Spectral Acceleration**: Calculates spectral accelerations for each mode
- **Base Shear Calculation**: Determines the total lateral force at the base of the structure
- **Story Force Distribution**: Distributes lateral forces along the height of the structure
- **Modal Combination**: Combines modal responses using appropriate methods

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Modal Superposition**: Uses modal superposition principle for analysis

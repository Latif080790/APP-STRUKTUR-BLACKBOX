## Production Deployment Workflow

The production deployment workflow for the APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX application is centered around the `deploy-production.sh` script, which automates the entire deployment process from pre-checks to final deployment instructions. The script begins with a comprehensive pre-deployment checklist that verifies Node.js and npm versions, checks dependency installation status, and ensures all prerequisites are met before proceeding.

The deployment process follows a seven-step methodology: pre-deployment checklist, production build, security and optimization, deployment options, performance optimization, backup and recovery setup, and deployment instructions generation. The script automatically creates a production build using `npm run build`, cleans previous builds, and verifies build success before proceeding. It then configures the production environment with appropriate security settings, including disabling console logs and debug mode while enabling strict mode for enhanced security.

The deployment workflow supports three primary deployment options: local network deployment for internal use with secure network access, cloud deployment for distributed teams with automatic scaling and SSL certificates, and desktop application deployment for offline capability. Each option is thoroughly documented with specific commands and configuration requirements to ensure successful deployment in various environments.

## Build Configuration

The build configuration for different environments is managed through the `vite.config.ts` file, which implements environment-specific optimizations and configurations. The configuration uses Vite's mode system to differentiate between development and production environments, applying appropriate optimizations based on the current mode.

In production mode, the build system implements several performance optimizations including code minification using esbuild, source map generation disabled, and targeted compilation for ES2018 to ensure compatibility while maintaining performance. The configuration includes chunk splitting strategies that group common dependencies into separate vendor chunks for better caching, including dedicated chunks for React, Three.js, charting libraries, PDF generation, and UI components.

The build process also implements asset optimization with specific naming conventions for JavaScript, CSS, and other assets to facilitate caching and versioning. Additional optimizations include a chunk size warning limit of 1000KB to prevent excessively large bundles and an assets inline limit of 4096 bytes to control the inlining of small assets. Environment variables are defined at build time, including application version, build timestamp, and production mode indicator, which are embedded in the compiled code for runtime reference.

## Server Requirements and Hosting Options

The APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX application has specific server requirements to ensure optimal performance and reliability in production environments. The minimum system requirements include Node.js 18+, npm 9+, 4GB of RAM, and 10GB of free disk space. These requirements ensure the application can handle complex structural analysis computations and serve multiple concurrent users effectively.

Three primary hosting options are available, each suited to different operational needs. Local network deployment is recommended for internal use in sensitive construction projects, providing secure internal network access with full control over data and access. This option typically uses a server running on port 3000 with network binding to 0.0.0.0 to allow internal access, and firewall rules configured to restrict access to specific IP ranges.

Cloud deployment options include Vercel, Netlify, and AWS/DigitalOcean, providing remote access capability, automatic scaling, and professional SSL certificates. Vercel deployment is recommended and can be accomplished using the Vercel CLI with the `vercel --prod` command, while Netlify deployment uses the Netlify CLI with build and deploy commands. For self-hosted solutions, Docker deployment on AWS or DigitalOcean is supported, using nginx to serve the static build files.

Desktop application deployment provides offline capability through Electron packaging, allowing standalone installation on engineer workstations without requiring internet connectivity. This option is ideal for field work or environments with limited network access.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment Pipeline

The continuous integration and deployment pipeline for APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX is designed to ensure code quality, automated testing, and reliable deployments. The pipeline is configured through npm scripts in the `package.json` file, which define various stages of the development and deployment process.

The pipeline begins with development scripts including `npm run dev` for local development, `npm run build` for production builds, and `npm run preview` for previewing production builds locally. For production deployment, the `deploy:production` script runs `build:prod` followed by `test:run` to ensure code quality before deployment. The `build:prod` script sets the NODE_ENV to production and runs TypeScript compilation followed by Vite build.

The pipeline includes comprehensive testing capabilities with `npm run test` for standard testing, `npm run test:ui` for interactive test UI, `npm run test:run` for non-interactive test execution, and `npm run test:coverage` for test coverage reporting. A health check script is also available using curl to verify server availability.

Pre-deployment checks are automated through the `deploy-production.sh` script, which verifies Node.js and npm versions, checks dependency installation, and ensures the environment is properly configured before proceeding with the build. The deployment process generates detailed deployment instructions in `DEPLOYMENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md`, providing step-by-step guidance for each deployment option.

## Backup and Recovery Procedures

The backup and recovery procedures for APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX are automated through the `backup.sh` script generated by the `deploy-production.sh` script during deployment setup. This script creates comprehensive backups of the system and data, ensuring business continuity and data preservation in case of system failures or data corruption.

The backup process creates compressed tar.gz archives of the entire project directory while excluding non-essential directories such as node_modules, dist, build, .git, and existing backups to optimize storage and backup speed. Each backup is timestamped with the format `structural_analysis_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz` and stored in the `./backups` directory. The script automatically creates the backup directory if it doesn't exist.

To manage storage space, the backup system implements a retention policy that keeps only the last 10 backups. After creating a new backup, the script automatically removes older backups beyond this limit, ensuring that storage requirements remain manageable while maintaining a sufficient history of system states for recovery purposes.

The backup and recovery strategy is integrated into the deployment workflow, with explicit instructions to run the backup script before deployment. This ensures that a recent backup is always available before making system changes, providing a safety net for rollback in case of deployment issues.

## Monitoring and Logging Strategies

The monitoring and logging strategies for APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX are designed to ensure system reliability, performance optimization, and rapid issue detection in production environments. The system includes a comprehensive performance monitoring solution implemented in the `performance-monitor.js` script, which tracks key performance metrics including request volume, response times, error rates, memory usage, and system uptime.

The performance monitor collects metrics on each request, tracking response duration, success status, and memory usage from process.memoryUsage(). These metrics are aggregated and written to a performance.log file every 100 requests, recording timestamps, total requests, average response time, average memory usage in MB, error rate percentage, and uptime in hours. This approach balances detailed monitoring with storage efficiency by batching log writes.

Daily monitoring tasks include checking system status using curl, monitoring performance logs with tail, and checking error rates by grepping log files. The system also includes health check endpoints to verify application status, 3D rendering functionality, analysis engine operation, and report generation capabilities.

The monitoring strategy is complemented by a comprehensive troubleshooting guide that provides specific commands for diagnosing common issues such as server startup problems, performance degradation, and validation errors. This includes commands to check port availability, monitor memory and CPU usage, and test the zero-tolerance validation system.

## Maintenance Schedules and Update Procedures

The maintenance schedules and update procedures for APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX follow a structured approach with daily, weekly, and monthly tasks designed to ensure system reliability, security, and optimal performance. The maintenance strategy is documented in both the deployment instructions and standard operating procedures, providing clear guidance for system administrators and engineering teams.

Daily maintenance tasks include checking server logs, monitoring error rates, verifying system availability, and reviewing performance metrics. These tasks ensure immediate detection of any system issues or performance degradation that could impact engineering workflows.

Weekly maintenance includes performance review, user feedback analysis, security updates, and backup verification. This regular cadence allows for proactive system optimization and ensures that user concerns are addressed in a timely manner. The weekly schedule also includes dependency updates when needed, balancing the need for security patches with system stability.

Monthly maintenance tasks focus on system optimization, professional engineering review, compliance audits, and feature planning. The compliance audit ensures adherence to SNI standards and other regulatory requirements, while the professional engineering review validates the accuracy and reliability of the analysis algorithms. This monthly review cycle supports continuous improvement while maintaining the highest standards of engineering integrity.

Post-deployment tasks are structured in a phased approach: immediate tasks on day one include testing validation scenarios and verifying zero-tolerance systems; week one tasks focus on team training and pilot project testing; and month one tasks involve full team rollout and process optimization.

## Security Hardening and Vulnerability Management

The security hardening and vulnerability management for APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX implements a comprehensive zero-tolerance approach to ensure structural safety and data integrity. The system's security model is designed around the principle that public safety must never be compromised, with multiple layers of validation and protection.

The production environment configuration disables console logs and debug mode while enabling strict mode to prevent information leakage and ensure code quality. Security settings in the deployment configuration include Helmet for HTTP header protection, CORS with credential support, and rate limiting to prevent abuse (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP).

The application implements a zero-tolerance validation system that automatically blocks construction if any safety violations are detected, including unlicensed engineers, substandard materials, unsafe structural geometry, inadequate seismic design, or load calculations exceeding safe limits. No manual override is allowed for these safety violations, requiring mandatory engineer review, design corrections, and system re-validation before proceeding.

Input validation is implemented at multiple levels, including file validation (size and type restrictions), input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks, and structural validation against SNI standards. The system also includes audit logging capabilities that record all critical actions with timestamps, details, and severity levels, providing a comprehensive audit trail for compliance and security review.

Regular security updates are part of the maintenance schedule, with weekly tasks including security updates and monthly compliance audits. The system's security model is documented in the standard operating procedures, which emphasize that safety protocols must be communicated to all team members and that safety must always be prioritized over project timelines or cost considerations.

## Disaster Recovery and Data Preservation

The disaster recovery and data preservation strategy for APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX is designed to ensure business continuity and protect critical engineering data in the event of system failures or disasters. The strategy combines automated backup systems with comprehensive documentation and recovery procedures to minimize downtime and data loss.

The automated backup system, implemented in the `backup.sh` script, creates regular backups of the entire system while excluding temporary and generated files. Backups are stored in the `./backups` directory with timestamped filenames and compressed to optimize storage. The system maintains a rolling window of the last 10 backups, automatically removing older backups to manage storage requirements while preserving sufficient history for recovery.

Data preservation is further enhanced through the use of version control (Git), which maintains the complete history of code changes and configuration. When combined with the backup system, this provides multiple layers of protection against data loss.

The disaster recovery plan includes explicit instructions to run the backup script before any deployment, ensuring a recent backup is always available before making system changes. In the event of a system failure, recovery involves restoring from the most recent backup and verifying system functionality through the health check process.

The recovery strategy is integrated with the deployment workflow, with the deployment instructions emphasizing the importance of backups and providing clear guidance on recovery procedures. The system's design ensures that both application code and configuration are preserved in backups, allowing for complete system restoration when needed.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

The troubleshooting guidance for common production issues in APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX provides systematic approaches to diagnose and resolve problems that may affect system availability, performance, or functionality. The guidance covers the most frequent issues encountered in production environments and provides step-by-step solutions.

For server startup issues, the primary troubleshooting steps include checking port availability using `lsof -i :3000`, killing conflicting processes with `sudo kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)`, and restarting the server. This addresses the common issue of port conflicts that prevent the application from starting.

Performance degradation issues are addressed by monitoring memory usage with `free -h`, checking CPU usage with `top -p $(pgrep node)`, and restarting the application if needed using process managers like PM2. For browser-based performance issues, solutions include closing unnecessary tabs, clearing browser cache, checking internet connection stability, and restarting the browser.

Validation errors are troubleshooted by verifying the calculation engine, checking SNI compliance through text searches in the build directory, and testing the zero-tolerance system with a POST request to the validation endpoint. Input-related validation failures require reviewing data accuracy, checking material grades against SNI standards, verifying engineer license information, and confirming seismic data for the project location.

General system access problems are addressed by checking server status, verifying localhost availability, clearing browser cache and cookies, and trying different browsers or incognito mode. For 3D visualization issues, verifying WebGL support through the browser's GPU information page (chrome://gpu/) is recommended.

The troubleshooting guide emphasizes contacting appropriate support personnel for persistent issues, with designated contacts for system issues (IT Administrator), engineering questions (Licensed Structural Engineer), business operations (Project Manager), and emergency support.

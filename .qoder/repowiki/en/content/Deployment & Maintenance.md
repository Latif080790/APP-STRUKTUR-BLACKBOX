## Production Deployment Workflow

The production deployment workflow for the APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX application is centered around the `deploy-production.sh` script, which automates the entire deployment process from pre-checks to final deployment instructions. The script begins with a comprehensive pre-deployment checklist that verifies Node.js and npm versions, checks dependency installation status, and ensures all prerequisites are met before proceeding.

The deployment process follows a seven-step methodology: pre-deployment checklist, production build, security and optimization, deployment options, performance optimization, backup and recovery setup, and deployment instructions generation. The script automatically creates a production build using `npm run build`, cleans previous builds, and verifies build success before proceeding. It then configures the production environment with appropriate security settings, including disabling console logs and debug mode while enabling strict mode for enhanced security.

The deployment workflow supports three primary deployment options: local network deployment for internal use with secure network access, cloud deployment for distributed teams with automatic scaling and SSL certificates, and desktop application deployment for offline capability. Each option is thoroughly documented with specific commands and configuration requirements to ensure successful deployment in various environments.

## Build Configuration

The build configuration for different environments is managed through the `vite.config.ts` file, which implements environment-specific optimizations and configurations. The configuration uses Vite's mode system to differentiate between development and production environments, applying appropriate optimizations based on the current mode.

In production mode, the build system implements several performance optimizations including code minification using esbuild, source map generation disabled, and targeted compilation for ES2018 to ensure compatibility while maintaining performance. The configuration includes chunk splitting strategies that group common dependencies into separate vendor chunks for better caching, including dedicated chunks for React, Three.js, charting libraries, PDF generation, and UI components.

The build process also implements asset optimization with specific naming conventions for JavaScript, CSS

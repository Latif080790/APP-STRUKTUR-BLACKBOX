## Introduction
The APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX application implements Indonesia's Standar Nasional Indonesia (SNI) for structural engineering design. This document details the implementation of four key SNI standards: SNI_1726_Gempa for seismic design, SNI_1727_Beban for load calculations, SNI_1729_Baja for steel structures, and SNI_2847_Beton for concrete design. These standards are integrated into a unified framework that enables engineers to validate structural designs against national requirements. The system provides comprehensive calculation methods, safety factors, material specifications, and compliance rules, with real-time feedback for non-compliant designs.

## SNI Standards Overview
The SNI standards implementation in APP-STRUKTUR-BLACKBOX provides a comprehensive framework for structural design compliance. Each standard addresses specific aspects of structural engineering, from seismic resilience to material-specific design requirements. The system integrates these standards through a unified interface that allows users to configure project-specific parameters and validate designs against multiple criteria simultaneously. The implementation follows a modular architecture where each SNI standard is encapsulated in its own module, enabling independent updates and maintenance while maintaining interoperability through the StandardIntegration.tsx interface.

## SNI_1726_Gempa: Seismic Design
SNI_1726:2019 governs seismic design requirements for building structures in Indonesia. The implementation includes seismic zone classification, soil type characterization, and building category definitions that determine the seismic response coefficient. The system incorporates four seismic zones (1-4) with increasing peak ground acceleration from 0.1g to 0.4g, five soil types (ZA-ZE) with amplification factors from 1.0 to 1.8, and four building categories (I-IV) with importance factors from 1.0 to 2.0.

The seismic coefficient calculation follows the formula: Cs = Z × S × I, where Z is the seismic zone acceleration, S is the soil amplification factor, and I is the building importance factor. The implementation also includes period-dependent modifications and minimum coefficient requirements. For

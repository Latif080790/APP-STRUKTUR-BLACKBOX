## Architecture Overview
The Enhanced3DViewer follows a component-based architecture that separates concerns between visualization, controls, and error handling. The main viewer component acts as the orchestrator, managing state and coordinating between the 3D scene renderer and control panel. React Three Fiber provides the React binding for Three.js, enabling declarative 3D scene composition while maintaining the performance benefits of the underlying WebGL rendering engine. The architecture implements a unidirectional data flow where user interactions in the control panel update the viewer's state, which then propagates changes to the 3D scene component for rendering. This separation allows for independent development and testing of components while ensuring consistent behavior across the visualization system.

## Scene Composition and Rendering
The Enhanced3DScene component implements a sophisticated rendering system that handles the visualization of structural elements, nodes, loads, and supports with high fidelity. The scene composition follows a hierarchical structure with proper coordinate system alignment to ensure accurate representation of structural analysis data. Elements are rendered with appropriate geometry based on their type (beam, column, slab, etc.) and material properties, while nodes are displayed as spheres with size scaling options. The rendering system supports multiple visualization modes, including solid, wireframe, and transparent rendering, allowing users to examine different aspects of the structural model. Color mapping is implemented to visualize analysis results, with gradient color schemes for stress and displacement values. The scene also includes environmental elements such as ground planes, coordinate axes, and grid helpers to provide spatial context and measurement references.

## Performance Optimizations
The Enhanced3DViewer implements several performance optimizations to ensure smooth rendering of complex structural models. Level of Detail (LOD) techniques are employed to reduce geometric complexity based on camera distance and model complexity, improving frame rates for large models. Frustum culling is implemented to avoid rendering objects outside the camera's view, significantly reducing the rendering workload. The component uses React.memo for memoization of expensive rendering operations and implements selective re-rendering to update only the portions of the scene that have changed. Object pooling is used for frequently created and destroyed elements, reducing garbage collection overhead. For animation sequences, the viewer implements efficient animation loops using requestAnimationFrame with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks. These optimizations work together to maintain interactive frame rates even with models containing thousands of structural elements.

## Error Handling and WebGL Recovery
The Enhanced3DErrorBoundary component provides comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms for the 3D visualization system. It implements a multi-layered approach to error management, starting with detailed error capture that includes not only the error message and stack trace but also contextual information such as WebGL capabilities, memory usage, and performance metrics. When an error occurs, the boundary displays a user-friendly error message with clear recovery options, including retry attempts and page reload. The component implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle transient WebGL issues, allowing the viewer to recover from temporary rendering failures. For persistent errors, it provides detailed technical information in a collapsible section to assist with debugging. The error boundary also integrates with error reporting services to capture and analyze errors in production environments, enabling continuous improvement of the visualization system's reliability.
